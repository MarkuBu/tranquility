## Exporting STLs

Load the file in openscad. Each side is made of four pieces. Comment out the bits you don't need at the bottom of the file. To get the right hand uncomment the 'mirror' line. The four pieces are top and bolts as one piece, bottom, caddy1 and caddy2. There are versions of the caddy for v3 and v4 of the elite-c.
